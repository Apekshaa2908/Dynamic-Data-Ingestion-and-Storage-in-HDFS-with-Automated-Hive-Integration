# Dynamic Data Ingestion and Storage in HDFS with Automated HiveIntegration
# Task:
The task involves fetching data from a specified link, storing it in HDFS, and creating a Hive table for visualization. Start by ensuring the link is accessible and that data retrieval is successful. Next, determine the data format and schema, if structured. Use wget or curl for data download and HDFS CLI for storage. Then, create a Hive table, load the data, and verify its correctness. Optionally, automate the entire process with a script.

# Steps:
**Verify Link Accessibility:** I’ll start by checking if the link is accessible and that I can download the data successfully.

**Assess Data Format and Structure:** Next, I’ll determine whether the data is a single file or multiple files, and whether it's structured or unstructured.

**Identify Data Schema (if structured):** If the data is structured, I'll identify its schema to prepare for Hive table creation.

**Download Data and Store in HDFS:** I’ll use wget or curl to download the data, and then pipe the output directly into HDFS using hadoop fs -put.

**Create Hive Database and Tabl**e: I'll launch the Hive CLI and create a new database and table that matches the data schema.

**Load Data into Hive:** Using the LOAD DATA INPATH HiveQL command, I’ll load the data from HDFS into the Hive table.

**Validate Data Integrity:** To ensure everything is correct, I’ll run a SELECT query in Hive to view and validate the loaded data.

**Automate the Process:** I’ll automate the entire process with a script, so future data updates are handled seamlessly.


By following the outlined approach, I successfully retrieved the data from the specified link, stored it in HDFS, and created a Hive table for visualization. The data within the Hive table was validated to ensure integrity and correctness. Additionally, a script was implemented to automate future data refreshes, enhancing the efficiency of the process.
